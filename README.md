## About
Application can receive and respond to TCP [IPv6 DNS][1] queries. Contents of queries are recorded and a log file is generated providing a history of all requests through proxy. Application caches recent queries, queries are expired in accordance to [TLL (time-to-live)][2].

### What is DNS?
Computers on the internet use IP addresses to communicate with each other. These addresses act as a unique identifier allowing traffic to be delivered to the correct destination. IP addresses like `142.250.70.206` (IPv4) or `2404:6800:4015:802::200e` (IPv6) are difficult to remember for humans as such we use hostnames such as `google` or `youtube` instead. However, our system still needs a way to find the IP from the hostname in order to communicate. This is where DNS comes in. DNS (Domain Name System) returns an IP address given a hostname, done by DNS servers communicating with nameservers which hold records containing hostnames and there IP address, if a nameserver contains the records it will return the IP address, if not the DNS server will then check another nameserver, the process repeats until the address is found. Nameservers are usually set up in a hierarchical structure as shown below.

## Running Project
Project must be run in an **Unix environment** due to unix dependent C libraries. 
Once project has been loaded in a unix environment (e.g. Ubuntu) use the Makefile to compile the various scripts. Type `make` in the terminal to do so.
This will generate a `dns_svr` executable. 

The application can be run using the following command:

```
./dns_svr <server-ip> <server-port>
```

Where, 

* **server-ip**: <br/>Is the Ipv4 address of the resolver server (a real world nameserver), use `cat /etc/resolv.conf` to see your local nameserver ip.
* **server-port**: <br/>Is the port that the nameserver with ip specified before is listening on. My default DNS uses `port 53`

When running the application will print `Listening on port 8053`, we can now send IPv6 queries to our proxy. This can be done with third-party tools such as [dig][3], use `sudo apt install dig` in Ubuntu to install dig.

<br/><br/>

With dig we can use the following command to send a query for google.com:
```
dig +tcp @<your ip address> -p 8053 AAAA google.com
```
Note, `+tcp` indicates we are using TCP to send the query. `AAAA` specifies we want to receive the IPv6 address.

Use `hostname -I` to find your local IP address in unix environment.

To terminate the application use SIGNINT (e.g. CTRL-C).
